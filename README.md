# Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect
Here I am implementing "Simple Estimation Methods forthe Helmholtz â€“ Kohlrausch Effect" by Nayatani to see what can be done about this effect. I am almost certain the implementation is not currently correct and the code is not too pretty yet.

### HKE:
![HKE demo](/images/equal_Y.png)
All the patches in the above image have the same Y luminance value as the background, but clearly look very different in terms of percieved luminance thanks to the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect

### Same image, but HKE compensated for:
![HKE demo](/images/HKE_compensated.png)
Here I have tried to compensate for the HKE effect using equations from Nayatani. I would say it has overcompensated, as the red looks too dark.

This is a work in progress.
